# Mangly

Mangly is an open-source manga and comic reading app designed to provide a smooth and modern reading experience.

> **Note:** Mangly uses an extension-based system to fetch content from various sources. Extensions are created and managed separately using the [Mangly Extension Builder](https://github.com/76eren/Mangly-extensions). These extensions can then be imported into the main app to enable access to content.
